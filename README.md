# Rock-paper-scissor-

Overview:-
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows users to play against the computer in a fun and interactive way. I created this project to showcase my ability to design logical structures, handle user inputs, and work with randomization in Python. The game is intuitive, easy to use, and serves as an excellent demonstration of programming fundamentals.

How It Works:-

The user is prompted to enter "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

1.The computer randomly selects its move.

2.The winner is determined based on the classic rules:

3.Rock beats Scissors

4,Scissors beats Paper

5,Paper beats Rock

6.Scores are updated accordingly, and the game continues until the user decides to quit.
